In our previous projects, we came across LoRaWAN Gateways from Dragino. We configured them and used them in our projects. But today we are not going to make any new project. We will get a closer look of the LoRaWAN Gateway and its working but before that we will refresh our concepts of the LoRa Technology after that we will come over to the LoRaWAN Technology and after that we will also discuss the working of LoRaWAN Gateway and LoRaWAN Servers.

LoRaWAN stands for LoRa based Wide Area Network. It is an advanced version of LoRa in which we connect our LoRa Networks to internet to get data over other devices outside the LoRa Network. For that purpose we need a LoRaWAN Gateway. A LoRaWAN Gateway has its own LoRa chip and an Internet chip like ESP8266. whihc are connected to each other. The LoRa chip of the Gateway connects to the LoRa node or Network and sends data to the Internet chip that internet chip is connected to the Server on the other end and tranfers data to that server. The data can be transferred from Server to the LoRa module as well in the reverse manner as mentioned above. In this way, The LoRaWAN Gateway acts as a bridge between the LoRa Network and Server and makes the connections possible.
